### Experience
1. The project has taken me about 2 days to complete it.  
It's a good chance for me to revise course.Keeping the name&function of the properties and the script in memory can saved many time.
2. Building up a App gets me a sense of achievement, especilly making it totally by my hand.
3. But the lighting, in other words,the Rendering showing a new world I have to explore further.Some specialized terminology can confused me for a long time. Such as the Render path, GUI, Shader are not so easy to understand.
